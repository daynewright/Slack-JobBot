# Craigslist Slack JobBot

A very simple Slack Bot that checks for new developer postings in Nashville every 12 hours. It will post a message with the new jobs found or a message informing the channel that no jobs were found.

## First Run
When the bot first run it will send a welcome message and run the first check
